# CECS 326 Project 1: File Copy and Process Programming
In the main file named fileprogram.cpp, to compile on a Linux/Mac system, type in the command "cpp filecopy.cpp -o filecopy" and run the program via the command "./filecopy [read file (named input.txt)] [destination file]". If running on a Windows system, there may have to be some modification of code since the library used <unistd.h> is only available on Mac/Linux systems. To test the validity of the program, try changing the text in "input.txt" and run it to see if it copies the text from input.txt to another file (File name include is "copy.txt").
